# Develop-a-Multi-Platform-2D-game-using-Unity
In past workshops, we’ve shown you how to use Unity for AR/VR in various contexts including  home automation. However the most popular use for the platform is still game development. In  this workshop we’ll show you how to build a 2D game in the style of the addictive Flappy Bird.  You’ll learn how to implement 2D physics, character/sprite animations, sound effects, level  design and a whole lot more. We’ll show you how to weave together all these elements for a  game and also get it ready to publish on Android or iOS.
